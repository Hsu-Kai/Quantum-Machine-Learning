# An Efficient and Scalable Scheme for Predicting Potential Energies of Complex Material Systems with Quantum Neural Networks

Abstract: Potential energy surface (PES), conceptually based on Born-Oppenheimer approximation, provides the potential energy of a material system given atomic positions. Fast evaluation of PES not only enables large-scale molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo modeling but also facilitates estimations of other material-dependent properties, and thereby, is an essential task. Conventional generation of PES via electronic structure calculation such as density functional theory (DFT) is usually highly computationally demanding, critically limiting the exploration of the configuration space. Although widely employed ML-based potential energy models have combined both time efficiency and accuracy relative to DFT, the idea of the energy partition ansatz is somehow not rigorous from the DFT point of view and the number of training parameters within the model along with the size of data needed still remains to be an issue.   

In this work, we utilize two quantum machine learning frameworks, namely, the quantum convolutional neural network and quantum deep neural network, to predict the potential energy of material systems without introducing the energy partition approximation. We also show that, by harnessing a novel binning approach to renormalize the atomic descriptor bases which serve as atomic fingerprints, it is possible to train a data- and parameter-efficient model that yields high prediction accuracy for complex material systems (up to five types of elements) of arbitrary system sizes. The present study therefore paves an alternative way for predicting the potential energy as well as other relevant material properties of complex material systems through quantum machine learning.
